# automatic-file-deleter
This program will delete all files of a specific file type if no file with the same name of another filetype exists.

Used for deletion of files if you delete some photos but have .jpg and .cr2. Mostly I will just delete one of the files, this is were this program comes to play. It will delete the file of the other filetype.
